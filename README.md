## Purpose
* The purpose of this telegram bot is that make your mood become better, No matter you are happy or unhappy now.

#### Why this motivation
* I thought that many people beside us are often in a bad mood in their lives. As a result, in order to express their mood, these people may need other people to talk with. However, most people in the modern society are busy all over time. This kind of phonomanon will cause that someone needs to company, but nobody can accompany with him or her.

* As mentioned reason above, so this bot is born!

## disadvantage
* No database
* Bot cannot serve two or more users simultaneously
    * It can use this method to solve
        * One user, one machine
* When bot chat with user, it will try to judge semantic of words of user's input. About **'judge'**, bot is sometimes weak.
    * We can add more and more word to bot, and then bot will **judge** more precise
